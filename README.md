# dotfiles

All my dotfiles.

`.bashrc` contains some useful aliases and fixes dircolors for ls

`.vimrc` is for vim running in WSL. (I use this currently)
`init_IDE` is for nvim running as GUI in Windows. 

Both have full plugins, lsp intellisense and snippet completion with tab. Install vim-plug, nodejs 13 LTS, Python 3 and OpenJdk 11 and patched fonts.
